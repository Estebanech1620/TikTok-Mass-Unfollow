TikTok Mass Unfollow Tool - Public Version
Developed by: DestinyX Studios
Written by: Estebanech
Date: February 2, 2025
Purpose: Automates the process of unfollowing users on TikTok while following rate limits.

Usage:
- The script asks for the user's TikTok username.
- The script navigates to the user's TikTok profile.
- The user manually clicks the "Following" button to open the list.
- The script ensures 200 users are unfollowed before stopping.

Features:
1. User inputs their TikTok username at runtime.
2. Unfollows **7 users at a time**, then scrolls down to load more.
3. Saves a log of unfollowed users (usernames or profile URLs) in `unfollowed_log.txt`.

TikTok Unfollowing Regulations:
- **Do not unfollow more than 200-300 users per day** to avoid account restrictions.
- **Unfollow in intervals** of 50-100 users every few hours to stay safe.
- **Keep delays of 2-5 seconds** between actions to mimic human behavior.

Disclaimer:
Use this script responsibly and in accordance with TikTok's terms of service.
Unauthorized use of automation may lead to account restrictions or bans.
